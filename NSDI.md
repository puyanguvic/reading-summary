## 2020' Contra: a programmable system for performance-aware routing
We present Contra, a system for performance-aware routing that can adapt to traffic changes at hardware speeds. While point solutions exist for a fixed topology (e.g., a Fattree) with a fixed routing policy (e.g., use least utilized paths), Contra can operate seamlessly over any network topology and a wide variety of sophisticated routing policies. Users of Contra write network-wide policies that rank network paths given their current performance. A compiler then analyzes such policies in conjunction with the network topology and decomposes them into switch-local P4 programs, which collectively implement a new, specialized distance-vector protocol. This protocol generates compact probes that traverse the network, gathering path metrics to optimize for the user policy dynamically. Switches respond to changing network conditions by routing flowlets along the best policy-compliant paths. Our experiments show that Contra scales to large networks, and that in terms of flow completion times, it is competitive with hand-crafted systems that have been customized for specific topologies and policies.

## 2020' FLAIR: accelerating reads with consistency-aware network routing
We present FLAIR, a novel approach for accelerating read operations in leader-based consensus protocols. FLAIR leverages the capabilities of the new generation of programmable switches to serve reads from follower replicas without compromising consistency. The core of the new approach is a packet-processing pipeline that can track client requests and system replies, identify consistent replicas, and at line speed, forward read requests to replicas that can serve the read without sacrificing linearizability. An additional benefit of FLAIR is that it facilitates devising novel consistency-aware load balancing techniques.

Following the new approach, we designed FlairKV, a key-value store atop Raft. FlairKV implements the processing pipeline using the P4 programming language. We evaluate the benefits of the proposed approach and compare it to previous approaches using a cluster with a Barefoot Tofino switch. Our evaluation indicates that, compared to state-of-the-art alternatives, the proposed approach can bring significant performance gains: up to 42% higher throughput and 35-97% lower latency for most workloads.

## 2020' Towards logically centralized interdomain routing
In this paper, we present the design and implementation of CIRCA, a logically centralized architecture and system for interdomain routing that enables operators to offload BGP-style route computation to the cloud while preserving the confidentiality of proprietary information. To this end, our work presents the first provably safe, live, and fully distributed convergence detection algorithm for decentralized policy routing and, somewhat surprisingly, shows that long MRAI timers can likely be completely eliminated while significantly improving convergence delays with logical centralization. Our experiments with a Quagga-based CIRCA prototype and the Internet's AS topologies suggest that CIRCA can improve interdomain routing convergence delays and transient route inconsistencies by over an order of magnitude and offers non-trivial incremental deployability benefits with modest changes to widely deployed routing infrastructure.

## 2018' Semi-oblivious traffic engineering: the road not taken
Networks are expected to provide reliable performance under a wide range of operating conditions, but existing traffic engineering (TE) solutions optimize for performance or robustness, but not both. A key factor that impacts the quality of a TE system is the set of paths used to carry traffic. Some systems rely on shortest paths, which leads to excessive congestion in topologies with bottleneck links, while others use paths that minimize congestion, which are brittle and prone to failure. This paper presents a system that uses a set of paths computed using Räcke's oblivious routing algorithm, as well as a centralized controller to dynamically adapt sending rates. Although oblivious routing and centralized TE have been studied previously in isolation, their combination is novel and powerful. We built a software framework to model TE solutions and conducted extensive experiments across a large number of topologies and scenarios, including the production backbone of a large content provider and an ISP. Our results show that semi-oblivious routing provides near-optimal performance and is far more robust than state-of-the-art systems.

## 2005' Decentralized, Adaptive Resource Allocation for Sensor Networks
This paper addresses the problem of resource allocation in sensor networks. We are concerned with how to allocate limited energy, radio bandwidth, and other resources to maximize the value of each node’s contribution to the network. Sensor networks present a novel resource allocation challenge: given extremely limited resources, varying node capabilities, and changing network conditions, how can one achieve efficient global behavior? Currently, this is accomplished by carefully tuning the behavior of the lowlevel sensor program to accomplish some global task, such as distributed event detection or in-network data aggregation. This manual tuning is difficult, error-prone, and typically does not consider network dynamics such as energy depletion caused by bursty communication patterns. We present Self-Organizing Resource Allocation (SORA), a new approach for achieving efficient resource allocation in sensor networks. Rather than manually tuning sensor resource usage, SORA defines a virtual market in which nodes sell goods (such as sensor readings or data aggregates) in response to prices that are established by the programmer. Nodes take actions to maximize their profit, subject to energy budget constraints. Nodes individually adapt their operation over time in response to feedback from payments, using reinforcement learning. The behavior of the network is determined by the price for each good, rather than by directly specifying local node programs. SORA provides a useful set of primitives for controlling the aggregate behavior of sensor networks despite variance of individual nodes. We present the SORA paradigm and a sensor network vehicle tracking application based on this design, as well as an extensive evaluation demonstrating that SORA realizes an efficient allocation of network resources that adapts to changing network conditions.
